# SNV-expression_integration
We have developed a systematic analytical approach to integrate non-coding somatic Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) with the altered expression of nearby genes, whereby, utilizing public genomic datasets, we have cataloged hundreds of genes appearing deregulated in association with nearby SNVs.
